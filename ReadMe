# Cornered Image Box
A corner image placed in each corner of a box, all done in CSS only.

## Usage:
Usage is pretty straightforward:

*Add the rules from the style.css to your own stylesheet.
*Add the image to your image folder and make the path to this image in your style sheet point to it.
*Create a div with the class `boxHolder` and put your content in it.
*After that div, create 4 empty divs.  Add the classes 'topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomLeft` and `bottomRight` respectively to each one (one per div, see the demo).
*Enjoy!
